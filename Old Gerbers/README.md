Design files for SIPM boards

BOM is here:  https://github.com/mgiacomelli/sipm/blob/master/TiaV3_BOM.xlsx

These are Gerber files for a SIPM+TIA detector board.  I'll update these eventually with a KiCAD design files when I have time to port over to KiCAD.  In the meantime, if you have questions or want to modify the design, contact me and I can help with that.
